# HEDM File Manipulation Utilities

Simple Linux shell utilities to manipulate GE2 or GE2 files produced during far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy (ff-HEDM) experiemnts.

Operations supported:

1. Combine multiple GE2/GE3/TIFF files.
2. Split large GE2/GE3 into frames.
3. GE2/3 to/from TIFF.
4. Maximum, sum, and mean intensity over multiple frames (and write the output to a file).
5. Display information about GE2/GE3 files in a folder.
