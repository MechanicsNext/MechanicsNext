# MIDAS Detector Calibration Template

This is a template for calibrating far-field HEDM detector parameters for use with MIDAS. Modify these files and perform calibration based on the [instructions in the Wiki](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/wiki/MIDAS-Analysis-Workflow).

## Acknowledgement

Our understanding of MIDAS calibration workflow is based on many helpful discussions with Hemant Sharma, Jun-sang Park, and Peter Kenesei (Advanced Photon Source, 1ID). Branden Kappes (Colorado School of Mines) prepared the first draft of this template.

This application uses Open Source components. You can find the source code of their open source projects along with license information below. We acknowledge and are grateful to these developers for their contributions to open source.
