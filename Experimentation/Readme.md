# Experimentation

These resources relate to experimental characterization of microstructure and deformation in metals.
At this time, following experimental tecniques are covered:

1. High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM):
2. Digital image correlation (DIC):

Following tools are available:

1. [DIC_image_processing](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/DIC_image_processing): Visualization and post-processing of strain data measured using digital image correlation (DIC) and processed with [NCORR](http://www.ncorr.com/) software.
2. [HEDM-file_utils](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_file_utils): Linux shell functions to manipulate data in GE2, GE3, or TIFF file format that is typically acquired during far-field HEDM experiments. These shell functions can be executed like any other Linux command.
3. [HEDM_forward_modeling](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_forward_modeling): Tools to simulate far-field or near-field HEDM diffraction patterns.
4. [HEDM_logging](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_logging): A Microsoft Word template for HEDM *lab notebook*.
5. [HEDM_macros](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_macros): A collection of SPEC macros to automate in-situ tension/compression HEDM experiment.
6. [HEDM_preprocessing](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_preprocessing): A utility to segment Bragg spots in HEDM data. This code accompanies the publication: Paranjape, H. M. et al., *An Algorithm to Segment Overlapping Bragg Peaks in Far-field High-energy Diffraction Microscopy Area Diffraction Patterns from Deformed Single and Multi-phase Materials*. (under peer review) Journal of Applied Crystallography.
7. [HEDM_specimen_geometry](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_specimen_geometry): Schematics of specimens used to perform in-situ tension/compression experiments at HEDM facilities. These specimens are best machined using electron discharge machining (EDM).
8. [HEDM_visualization](https://github.com/MechanicsNext/MechanicsNext/tree/master/Experimentation/HEDM_visualization): Matlab scripts to post-process and visualize output from [MIDAS](https://github.com/marinerhemant/MIDAS) and [heXRD](https://github.com/praxes/hexrd) HEDM data analysis software.
