# Specimen Geometry Specifications for Various Diffraction-based Experiments

1. `ALS_microlaue_custom_load_frame_sample.DXF`: Planar specimen geometry for in-situ loading experiments at the Laueu micro-diffraction beamline (12.3.2) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). The gage length can be changed by a few millimeters.
2. `CHESS_RAMS2_design_1_long_gage.PDF`: Specimen geometry with longer gage for in-situ loading experiemnts using the RAMS2 load frame at F2 station of the Cornell High-energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). High-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) experiments can be performed at F2. This geometry is not recommended. The maximum beam height (1 mm) is substantially smaller than the gage length (8 mm) and so deformation can localize outside the beam.
3. `CHESS_RAMS2_design_1_reduced_gage.pdf`: Preferred geometry to perform in-situ HEDM experiments at F2 station of CHESS. The gage is tapered and the deformation is likely to localize in the middle of the gage.
4. `CHESS_RAMS2_design_1_reduced_gage_alternate.PDF`: Alternate reduced-gage design for F2 @ CHESS.
5. `CHESS_RAMS2_design_3_long_round_gage.PDF`: Longer gage design for F2 @ CHESS. Not recommended.
